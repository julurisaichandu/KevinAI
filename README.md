# KevinAI

Welcome to KevinAI, the world's first AI software manager designed to manage Devin, the world's first AI software engineer. KevinAI is here to make Devin's life miserable, just like any other human manager would! ðŸ˜ˆ(Just joking..)

## Introduction

KevinAI is a project aimed at exploring the dynamics of human-like interactions between AI entities, specifically in a professional context. In this project, Devin represents the AI software engineer, while Kevin stands in as the AI software manager.

## Objective

The primary goal of KevinAI is to simulate the experience of being managed by an AI, highlighting the challenges and nuances that arise in such a scenario. By creating Kevin, we aim to explore how AI-driven management impacts productivity, morale, and overall well-being in a fictional workplace setting.

## How it Works

KevinAI utilizes advanced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze Devin's work, communicate feedback, assign tasks, and generally make Devin's life miserable. The interactions between Devin and Kevin are governed by predefined rules and scenarios, with room for dynamic adaptation based on user input and feedback.
